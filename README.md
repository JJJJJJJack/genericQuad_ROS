# genericQuad_ROS
A generic quadcopter simulation based on MATLAB/Simulink model. The repo is a ros package that auto generated by Simulink codegen. To modify the model, change the simulink file instead of the source c++ code.

## Control command
Send "~/cmd_vel" (geometry_msgs/Twist) to the node to control the velocity of the vehicle.

## Running multiple quadcopters
The ros package support multi-quad simulation. A launch file example is provided under launch folder. Quadcopters must be separated by 'groups'.
